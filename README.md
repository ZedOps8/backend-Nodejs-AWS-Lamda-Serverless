## Getting Started

Before you dive into the Lambda use cases, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- AWS CLI installed and configured with your AWS credentials

## Use Cases

In this repository, you'll find Lambda functions and code samples for various serverless use cases, including:

1. [Image Processing](./image-processing/): Resize and process images when they're uploaded to an S3 bucket.
2. [Real-time Data Processing](./real-time-data-processing/): Process streaming data from sources like Amazon Kinesis.
3. [API Backends](./api-backends/): Create serverless API backends using Lambda with Amazon API Gateway.
4. [Scheduled Tasks](./scheduled-tasks/): Automate tasks with scheduled events using CloudWatch Events.
5. [Authentication and Authorization](./authentication-authorization/): Implement custom authentication and authorization logic for your applications.
6. [Text Analysis](./text-analysis/): Perform sentiment analysis, language translation, and more.
7. [IoT Device Communication](./iot-device-communication/): Process messages from IoT devices and trigger actions based on sensor data.
8. [E-commerce Order Processing](./e-commerce-order-processing/): Process and fulfill orders in an e-commerce system.
9. [User Management](./user-management/): Register and authenticate users in your application.
10. [File Conversion](./file-conversion/): Convert files between different formats, e.g., PDF to Word or Excel.

Feel free to explore these directories to find detailed code and READMEs for each use case.

## How to Use

Each use case directory contains its own README.md with instructions on how to set up and deploy the AWS Lambda function. You'll typically find the following information in each use case folder:

1. Code snippet in Node.js.
2. Detailed setup instructions.
3. Required AWS services and configurations.
4. Any additional resources or dependencies.

To get started with a specific use case, navigate to its respective directory and follow the provided instructions.
